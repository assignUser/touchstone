#' Sources a script
#'
#' Basically [base::source()], but prepending the library path with a
#' touchstone library and running the script in a temp directory to avoid
#' git operations like checking out different branches to interfere with the
#' script execution (as running the script changes itself through git checkout).
#'
#' @param path The script to run. It must fulfill the requirements of a
#'   [touchstone_script].
#' @param ref The branch that corresponds to the library that should be prepended
#'   to the library path when the script at `path` is executed, see 'Why this
#'   function?' below.
#' @section How to run this interactively?:
#' In a GitHub Action workflow, the environment variables `GITHUB_BASE_REF` and
#' `GITHUB_HEAD_REF` denote the target and source branch of the pull request -
#' and these are default arguments in [benchmark_run_ref()] (and other functions
#' you probably want to call in your benchmarking script) to determinate the
#' branches to use. Hence, you must set these with [base::Sys.setenv()], e.g. if
#' you want to benchmark the local branch `devel` against `main`
#' ```
#' Sys.setenv(GITHUB_BASE_REF = "main", GITHUB_HEAD_REF = "devel")
#' ```
#' @section Why this function?:
#' For isolation, \{touchstone\} does not allow the benchmarked package to be
#' installed in the global package library, but only in touchstone libraries, as
#' asserted with [assert_no_global_installation()]. However, this also implies
#' that the package is not available in the touchstone script outside of
#' benchmark runs (i.e. outside of [benchmark_run_ref()]. We sometimes still
#' want to call that package to prepare a benchmarking run though. To
#' allow this, we prepend a touchstone library location that
#' contains the installed benchmarked package for set-up tasks, and temporarily
#' remove it during benchmarking with [benchmark_run_ref()] so only one
#' touchstone library is on the library path at any time.
#' @return
#' The same as [base::source()], which inherits from [base::withVisible()], i.e.
#' a list with `value` and `visible` (invisibly).
#' @export
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' # assuming you want to compare the branch master with the branch devel
#' if (requireNamespace("withr")) {
#'   withr::with_envvar(
#'     c("GITHUB_BASE_REF" = "main", "GITHUB_HEAD_REF" = "devel"),
#'     run_script("touchstone/script.R")
#'   )
#' }
#' }

#' The script for benchmarking

#' @name touchstone_script
#' @section Requirements:
#'
#' A touchstone script must:
#'
#' * install all versions of the benchmarked repository with [refs_install()].
#' * create benchmarks with one or more calls to [benchmark_run_ref()].
#' * produce the artifacts required in the GitHub workflow with
#'   [benchmarks_analyze()].
